//! The `gzclose` family of the gzip file-I/O layer.
//!
//! This module is the faithful Rust port of the C `gzclose.c` dispatcher
//! (`gzclose.c` L11-L23) together with the two direction-specific finalizers
//! that live in the read and write translation units of reference zlib:
//!
//! * [`gzclose_r`] &larr; C `gzclose_r` (`gzread.c` L645-L668)
//! * [`gzclose_w`] &larr; C `gzclose_w` (`gzwrite.c` L667-L700)
//! * [`gzclose`]   &larr; C `gzclose`   (`gzclose.c` L11-L23)
//!
//! In reference zlib these three entry points are deliberately split across
//! three source files so that a program linking only the reader or only the
//! writer does not drag in the other half of the library. That link-time
//! concern does not exist for a single Rust crate, so — per the migration's
//! function-family reorganization — all three are consolidated here while
//! preserving the exact C control flow and return-code contract required for
//! API/FFI parity.
//!
//! # Ownership &amp; RAII
//!
//! The C `gzFile` is an opaque pointer that the `gzclose*` functions *free*.
//! In this safe layer the close functions instead **consume an owned handle**,
//! [`Box<GzState>`]. Returning from a close function drops that box, and the
//! [`Drop`] implementation for [`GzState`] performs the resource teardown that
//! C does by hand:
//!
//! * the input/output [`Vec<u8>`](alloc::vec::Vec) buffers free their storage
//!   (C `free(state->in)` / `free(state->out)`);
//! * the embedded stream runs its own `Drop`, which is the
//!   `inflateEnd`/`deflateEnd` equivalent; and
//! * the owned [`File`](std::fs::File) closes the descriptor (C `close(fd)`).
//!
//! Consequently the functions here contribute only the parts that RAII *cannot*
//! express: the read/write **direction dispatch**, the mandatory write-side
//! `Z_FINISH` flush that finalizes the gzip member (the sliding-window `Drop`
//! deliberately does *not* flush, so that write errors remain observable), and
//! the reconstruction of zlib's integer return-code contract.
//!
//! The `#[no_mangle] extern "C"` shim in `src/ffi/gz.rs` bridges the raw
//! `gzFile` pointer to these owned-handle functions: it validates the pointer
//! (rejecting `NULL` with `Z_STREAM_ERROR`, the check that C performs at the top
//! of each function) and reconstructs the `Box` with `Box::from_raw` before
//! calling in. Because that pointer bookkeeping is confined to the FFI layer,
//! this module contains **zero `unsafe`**, enforced by the
//! `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` attribute below.
