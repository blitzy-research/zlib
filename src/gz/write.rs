//! The **write** side of the gzip file-I/O layer (`gz*` writing API) — a
//! faithful, memory-safe Rust port of C `gzwrite.c`.
//!
//! This module implements the stdio-like `gz*` writing entry points
//! (`gzwrite`, `gzfwrite`, `gzputc`, `gzputs`, `gzprintf`, `gzflush`) plus the
//! internal compress pipeline (`gz_init`, `gz_comp`, `gz_zero`, `gz_write`)
//! that drives compression through the crate's DEFLATE engine
//! ([`crate::deflate`]). It operates entirely on the shared
//! [`GzState`](crate::gz::state::GzState) defined by the gz-layer state module,
//! and produces output that is **byte-identical** to reference zlib for the
//! same input, level, and strategy, framed as a valid gzip member (RFC 1952).
//!
//! # Relationship to C `gzwrite.c`
//!
//! The port preserves the C structure function-for-function (C source line
//! ranges are cited in comments), but replaces the raw `z_stream` cursor
//! quadruple (`next_in`/`avail_in`/`next_out`/`avail_out`) and the manual
//! `malloc`/`free` bookkeeping with safe Rust:
//!
//! * The idiomatic [`crate::deflate::deflate`] takes the input and output as
//!   **slices** per call and returns a [`DeflateOutcome`](crate::deflate::DeflateOutcome)
//!   (`consumed`/`produced`/`code`) — there is no persistent `next_out` cursor
//!   inside [`ZStream`](crate::stream::ZStream). This module therefore owns the
//!   buffering: the compressed output is flushed to the file after each
//!   `deflate` call, which is byte-identical to the C behaviour of accumulating
//!   in `state->out` before writing (the DEFLATE byte stream is independent of
//!   how the output is chunked).
//! * The C write path never uses the `gzFile_s.have` window field, so this port
//!   repurposes [`GzState::have`](crate::gz::state::GzState) to hold the count of
//!   **buffered, not-yet-compressed input bytes** (the C `strm.avail_in`). The
//!   buffered input always begins at `in_buf[0]` (the C `next_in == in`
//!   invariant), so pending input is exactly `in_buf[0..have]`.
//! * `deflateEnd`/`free`/`close` are subsumed by RAII: dropping the
//!   [`GzState`](crate::gz::state::GzState) releases the buffers, the engine
//!   state, and the OS file handle.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! This module contains **zero `unsafe`**. All buffer access is bounds-checked
//! slice indexing; the raw C-string / raw-pointer handling for the FFI `gz*`
//! entry points lives in `src/ffi/gz.rs`, never here. The public
//! [`std::io::Write`] implementation on [`GzState`](crate::gz::state::GzState)
//! offers an idiomatic Rust API alongside the C-compatible functions.

// Compile-enforce the folder unsafe-policy: this module must contain zero
// `unsafe` (all raw-pointer / C-string handling for the FFI `gz*` entry points
// lives in `src/ffi/gz.rs`). Mirrors the sibling deflate modules.
