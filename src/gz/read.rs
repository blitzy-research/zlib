//! The READ side of the gzip file-I/O layer (`gz*` reading API) of the
//! `zlib-rs` crate — a faithful, memory-safe Rust port of C `gzread.c`.
//!
//! This module implements the stdio-like `gz*` reading functions
//! ([`gzread`], [`gzfread`], [`gzgetc`], [`gzungetc`], [`gzgets`]) together with
//! the look-ahead / decompress pipeline that drives them: the `LOOK` → `COPY` /
//! `GZIP` mode transitions ([`How`]), gzip-header sniffing, transparent
//! pass-through of non-gzip input, and multi-member gzip decoding. Decompression
//! is performed by the crate's inflate engine ([`crate::inflate`]); the gzip
//! CRC-32 + `ISIZE` trailer is verified *inside* that engine, so this layer never
//! touches [`crate::checksum`] directly.
//!
//! The behaviour — buffering, transparent copy, EOF / `EAGAIN` (again) handling,
//! and trailing-garbage tolerance — matches reference zlib exactly.
//!
//! # Relationship to the C input model
//!
//! Reference zlib stores the *compressed-input* cursor on the embedded
//! `z_stream` (`strm.next_in` / `strm.avail_in`). This crate's idiomatic
//! [`ZStream`](crate::stream::ZStream) carries **no** such cursor fields — input
//! is handed to [`inflate`](crate::inflate::inflate) as a `&[u8]` slice on every
//! call, and the number of bytes consumed is reported back explicitly. The read
//! driver therefore keeps that bookkeeping itself, on the gz state: the
//! not-yet-decompressed compressed input is the slice
//! `in_buf[in_next .. in_next + in_avail]` (see
//! [`GzState::in_next`](crate::gz::state::GzState) /
//! [`GzState::in_avail`](crate::gz::state::GzState)). The decompressed output the
//! caller has not yet consumed is likewise the slice `out_buf[next .. next + have]`.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! This module contains **zero `unsafe`**. The moving C pointers `strm.next_in`,
//! `strm.next_out`, and `state->x.next` become plain `usize` indices, so all
//! buffer access is bounds-checked slice indexing. Because the idiomatic
//! [`inflate`](crate::inflate::inflate) takes input/output as *separate* slice
//! arguments (never as fields of the state), the output buffer is temporarily
//! moved out of the state with [`std::mem::take`] while it is written, which lets
//! the input buffer, the stream, and the output buffer be borrowed
//! simultaneously without any raw pointers.
