//! `deflate_fast` — the greedy (non-lazy) match finder.
//!
//! Safe-Rust port of the C `deflate_fast` function (`deflate.c` L1857-L1948)
//! from **zlib 1.3.2.1-motley**. This is the block producer selected for
//! compression levels 1-3 ([`CompressFunc::Fast`](crate::deflate::strategy::CompressFunc::Fast)).
//! It performs a single *greedy* search at each input position and takes the
//! first match it finds, in contrast to the lazy-evaluating `deflate_slow`
//! used at levels 4-9, which may defer a match by one byte for a better result.
//!
//! # Byte-for-byte compatibility
//!
//! The emitted token stream — and therefore the compressed bytes — must be
//! identical to reference zlib for the same input, level and strategy
//! (AAP §0.6.4). Every decision that influences which symbols are tallied is
//! reproduced exactly:
//!
//! * a match is searched for only when the hash chain is non-empty *and* the
//!   candidate distance is within [`DeflateState::max_dist`];
//! * after a match is emitted, the strings covered by the matched bytes are
//!   re-inserted into the hash table only when the match is short enough
//!   (`match_length <= max_insert_length`) and enough lookahead remains — this
//!   is what lets later matches reference interior positions of an earlier
//!   match, and omitting it would change the token stream;
//! * the trailing [`DeflateState::insert`] bookkeeping value is computed with
//!   the same `strstart < MIN_MATCH - 1 ? strstart : MIN_MATCH - 1` rule.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! This module contains **zero** `unsafe` (AAP §0.6.2, §0.7.2 standard S2): all window and
//! buffer access goes through bounds-checked indexing, and all cleanup is
//! handled by ownership in [`DeflateState`]. The two `usize` subtractions that
//! could in principle underflow — `strstart - hash_head` and
//! `strstart - match_start` — are only evaluated once their operands are known
//! to satisfy the ordering invariant, as documented at each call site. The
//! window reads in the "match too long" branch are proven in-bounds by the
//! `fill_window` invariant `strstart <= window_size - MIN_LOOKAHEAD`
//! (`deflate.c` L247, L374): since `match_length <= MAX_MATCH` and
//! `MIN_LOOKAHEAD == MAX_MATCH + MIN_MATCH + 1`, the advanced `strstart` never
//! exceeds `window_size - 4`, so `window[strstart + 1]` stays within the
//! `2 * w_size` window.
//!
//! # `no_std`
//!
//! The module relies only on `core` and the crate's internal modules; it needs
//! no direct heap allocation of its own.
