//! The `deflate_slow` lazy-match compressor (used by levels 4-9).
//!
//! This module is a faithful, **`100%` safe-Rust** port of the C
//! `deflate_slow` function (`deflate.c` L1955-L2076) together with the
//! `FLUSH_BLOCK` / `FLUSH_BLOCK_ONLY` macros (`deflate.c` L1630-L1645) that it
//! relies on. It is the highest-compression-ratio block producer in zlib and is
//! selected for compression levels 4 through 9 (see
//! [`CONFIGURATION_TABLE`](crate::deflate::strategy::CONFIGURATION_TABLE)).
//!
//! # Lazy evaluation
//!
//! Unlike [`deflate_fast`], `deflate_slow` uses *lazy* match evaluation: after
//! finding a match at the current position it does **not** emit it immediately.
//! Instead it advances one position and searches again; the earlier match is
//! only adopted (emitted) if the next position does not yield a strictly longer
//! match. This one-position deferral is what earns the extra compression, and it
//! is the single most subtle part of the algorithm — a pending literal is
//! carried in [`match_available`](crate::deflate::state::DeflateState::match_available)
//! and emitted one position late.
//!
//! # Byte-exact fidelity
//!
//! The produced DEFLATE token stream is **byte-identical** to reference zlib for
//! the same input, compression level, and strategy. Three details are
//! load-bearing for that guarantee and are reproduced exactly:
//!
//! 1. The distance of the *previous* match is `strstart - 1 - prev_match` (note
//!    the `- 1`), and its length code argument is `prev_length - MIN_MATCH`.
//! 2. The hash-insertion loop that runs after emitting a match uses the bound
//!    `max_insert = strstart + lookahead - MIN_MATCH` and only inserts while
//!    `strstart <= max_insert`, mirroring the C
//!    `do { if (++strstart <= max_insert) INSERT_STRING(...); } while (--prev_length != 0);`
//!    structure precisely (with the `prev_length -= 2` pre-decrement).
//! 3. The match filter — reject a match of length `<= 5` when the strategy is
//!    [`Strategy::Filtered`] *or* when it is exactly `MIN_MATCH` long and reaches
//!    farther than [`TOO_FAR`] (4096) bytes back — is what makes `Z_FILTERED`
//!    differ from the default strategy.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! This file contains **zero** `unsafe` code, enforced by the module-level
//! `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` below. All window and buffer access uses safe slice
//! indexing on the owned `Vec` buffers held by
//! [`DeflateState`], and match finding /
//! bit output are delegated to the safe methods on that state.
