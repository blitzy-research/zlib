//! Deflate strategy selection: block-state signalling, compress-function
//! dispatch tags, and the per-level heuristic configuration table.
//!
//! This module is the safe-Rust translation of three closely related pieces of
//! `deflate.c` from **zlib 1.3.2.1-motley**:
//!
//! * the `block_state` enumeration (`deflate.c` L63-L68) — the value every
//!   block producer returns to tell the `deflate()` driver how far it
//!   progressed;
//! * the `compress_func` function-pointer typedef (`deflate.c` L70) — replaced
//!   here by the [`CompressFunc`] tag enum so the driver can dispatch with an
//!   exhaustive `match` instead of an indirect call; and
//! * the `config` struct and its `configuration_table` (`deflate.c` L88-L124) —
//!   the ten tuning presets (one per compression level `0..=9`) that steer the
//!   match finder.
//!
//! # Strategy pattern, without function pointers
//!
//! The C library selects a block producer through a table of raw function
//! pointers (`compress_func`). Porting that verbatim would require `unsafe` and
//! would forfeit the compiler's exhaustiveness checking. Instead, each row of
//! [`CONFIGURATION_TABLE`] carries a [`CompressFunc`] *tag*; the deflate driver
//! in `mod.rs` turns that tag into a concrete call with a `match`. This keeps
//! the whole compression core free of `unsafe` (AAP §0.3.2, §0.6.2) while
//! preserving the exact selection behaviour of the original.
//!
//! # This module is intentionally data-only
//!
//! It contains **no** compression logic and does **not** call the block
//! producers. Its only dependency is [`crate::constants::Strategy`]. Keeping it
//! dependency-light lets it be compiled before the block producers — which all
//! return [`BlockState`] — without creating an import cycle.
//!
//! # Byte-for-byte compatibility
//!
//! The heuristic fields (`good_length`, `max_lazy`, `nice_length`, `max_chain`)
//! drive the lazy-match decisions that determine the emitted token stream. They
//! are reproduced **exactly** from `deflate.c`; altering any value would make
//! the compressed output diverge from reference zlib (AAP §0.6.4).
//!
//! # Safety and portability
//!
//! Zero `unsafe`, no heap allocation, and `no_std`-compatible: the module
//! relies only on `core`.
