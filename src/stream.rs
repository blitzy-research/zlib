//! The idiomatic streaming state object [`ZStream`] — the safe-Rust port of the
//! C `z_stream` (`zlib.h` L88-L110) — together with the crate-local
//! [`Allocator`] abstraction that replaces the C `zalloc`/`zfree` hooks.
//!
//! `ZStream` is the **central owning handle** of the whole library and is
//! re-exported from the crate root (`lib.rs`). Every compression or
//! decompression operation borrows a `&mut ZStream`; the concrete engine logic
//! lives in [`crate::deflate`] and [`crate::inflate`], which operate on the
//! [`DeflateState`] / [`InflateState`] this handle owns.
//!
//! # Relationship to the C `z_stream`
//!
//! The C library models a stream as a `z_stream` struct that the caller
//! allocates and whose opaque `internal_state *state` pointer is filled in by
//! `deflateInit`/`inflateInit` and torn down by `deflateEnd`/`inflateEnd`. That
//! design has two classic hazards this port makes *unrepresentable*:
//!
//! * A `state` pointer that is dangling, `NULL`, or points at the *wrong* kind
//!   of engine (an inflate routine handed a deflate state, or vice-versa).
//! * A manual `zcfree` that is forgotten (leak) or performed twice
//!   (use-after-free / double-free).
//!
//! Here the engine state is owned through a `StreamState` enum that holds
//! *at most one* boxed engine (`None`, `Deflate(Box<…>)`, or
//! `Inflate(Box<…>)`), so "no state", "deflate state", and "inflate state" are
//! distinct, checked cases (AAP §0.3.2 Type-State / Ownership). Because the box
//! and every owned buffer inside it are released by `Drop`, RAII fully subsumes
//! `deflateEnd`/`inflateEnd` (AAP §0.3.2 RAII / §0.6.3 Memory Ownership Model) —
//! there is nothing for the caller to remember to free.
//!
//! ## Field mapping (`z_stream` → [`ZStream`])
//!
//! | C field (`z_stream`)          | Rust                                   |
//! |-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
//! | `next_in` / `next_out`        | *not stored* — passed as slices to the deflate/inflate methods |
//! | `avail_in` / `avail_out`      | *not stored* — the length of those slices; reconstructed at the FFI boundary |
//! | `total_in` / `total_out`      | [`total_in`](ZStream::total_in) / [`total_out`](ZStream::total_out) (`u64`) |
//! | `msg`                         | [`msg`](ZStream::msg) (`Option<&'static str>`) |
//! | `state`                       | `state` (`StreamState`, owned) |
//! | `zalloc` / `zfree` / `opaque` | `alloc` (`A: Allocator`) |
//! | `data_type`                   | [`data_type`](ZStream::data_type) (`i32`) |
//! | `adler`                       | [`adler`](ZStream::adler) (`u32`) |
//! | `reserved`                    | `reserved` (`u32`, parity only) |
//!
//! The raw `next_in`/`avail_in`/`next_out`/`avail_out` cursor quadruple is
//! **not** mirrored as fields: the idiomatic API accepts input and output as
//! Rust slices (for example `deflate(&mut self, input: &[u8], output: &mut [u8],
//! flush: FlushMode)`), and the running [`total_in`](ZStream::total_in) /
//! [`total_out`](ZStream::total_out) counters record cumulative progress. When
//! the crate is driven through its C ABI, the `ffi` layer rebuilds those slices
//! from the caller's raw `z_stream.next_in`/`avail_in`/… on each call and writes
//! the advanced cursors back afterwards.
//!
//! # Allocation
//!
//! The C `z_stream` carries `zalloc`/`zfree` function pointers so callers can
//! supply a custom allocator (for arenas, memory accounting, or embedded
//! heaps). That capability is modelled by the [`Allocator`] trait: the default
//! [`DefaultAllocator`] routes through the Rust global allocator, while the
//! `ffi` layer supplies a [`CAllocator`](crate::ffi::CAllocator) implementation
//! that forwards to the caller's `zalloc`/`zfree` (AAP §0.6.3, "has-hook
//! clause"). Every working buffer the engines request —
//! [`allocate_zeroed`](Allocator::allocate_zeroed) — is returned as an
//! [`AllocBuffer`], a smart owned region that is **either** a global-allocator
//! [`Vec`] (the null-hook default, byte-for-byte the historical behavior)
//! **or** a foreign region obtained from the caller's `zalloc` and released
//! through their `zfree` when the box drops. The engines only ever see a slice
//! ([`Deref`]/[`DerefMut`]), so which backing store is in play is invisible to
//! the compression/decompression logic and requires **no** `unsafe` on their
//! side.
//!
//! # Safety, `no_std`
//!
//! This module contains **zero `unsafe`** (enforced by `#![deny(unsafe_code)]`
//! below). The raw-pointer work for a caller-`zalloc`'d region — invoking the C
//! `zalloc`/`zfree` function pointers, materializing a slice over the returned
//! memory, and freeing it on drop — is defined entirely in the sanctioned
//! `crate::ffi::alloc` zone behind the safe [`ForeignBuffer`] trait (M6). The
//! [`Foreign`](AllocBuffer::Foreign) arm holds a `Box<dyn ForeignBuffer<T>>` and
//! delegates every access to that safe interface. Consequently the **core
//! compression engine** (`src/deflate/**`) also contains **zero `unsafe`** (User
//! Constraint 3 / AAP §0.7.2 standard S2) — its buffer fields are [`AllocBuffer`]s
//! accessed purely through safe slice operations, and the compression-logic
//! files (`slow.rs`/`stored.rs`/`trees.rs`) remain under `#![deny(unsafe_code)]`.
//!
//! Allocation is **fallible** at the boundary: when a caller installs a bounded
//! allocator whose `zalloc` reports out-of-memory, buffer construction returns
//! [`None`] and the init paths surface `Z_MEM_ERROR` (M7) rather than silently
//! using the global allocator. The module is `no_std` + `alloc` compatible: it
//! references only `core`, `alloc`, and the crate's own modules.
