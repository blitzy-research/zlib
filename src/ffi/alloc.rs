//! Caller-allocator (`zalloc`/`zfree`) buffer bridge — the sanctioned home of
//! the raw-pointer allocation hook.
//!
//! # Why this module exists (M6)
//!
//! zlib lets a C caller override allocation through the `z_stream`
//! `zalloc`/`zfree`/`opaque` triple (`zlib.h` L85-L86; AAP §0.6.3). Honoring that
//! contract requires calling a raw C function pointer, materializing the returned
//! raw pointer as a slice, and releasing it through the matching `zfree` on drop
//! — all `unsafe` operations.
//!
//! Per the migration's unsafe-isolation strategy (AAP §0.6.2 / §0.7.2 standard S2), **all**
//! `unsafe` in the crate is confined to the `ffi` tree. This module is that
//! confinement point for the allocator hook: it defines [`CForeignBuffer`], the
//! sole implementor of the safe [`ForeignBuffer`] interface consumed by
//! [`crate::stream::AllocBuffer`]. Because `stream.rs` and the compression /
//! decompression engines see only the safe [`ForeignBuffer`] methods, they
//! contain **zero** `unsafe` — the raw-pointer work lives exclusively here.
//!
//! # Fallible allocation (M7)
//!
//! [`try_alloc_foreign`] returns [`None`] when the caller's `zalloc` reports
//! out-of-memory (or the request size is unrepresentable in the C `uInt` hook
//! ABI). It never silently falls back to the global allocator; that choice is
//! what lets the deflate/inflate initialization paths surface `Z_MEM_ERROR`
//! exactly as the C library does, rather than masking an OOM from a caller who
//! deliberately installed a bounded allocator.
