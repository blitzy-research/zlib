//! Inflate fast decode loop (`inflate_fast`) — port of C `inffast.c`.
//!
//! This is the throughput-critical inner decode loop invoked by the main
//! `inflate()` driver (in [`crate::inflate`]'s `mod.rs`) whenever there is
//! *enough* input and output available to decode literal, length, and distance
//! codes without re-checking buffer bounds on every symbol. When large enough
//! buffers are supplied, more than 95% of `inflate()` execution time is spent
//! here (see the C source header comment in `inffast.c`).
//!
//! # Unsafe policy
//!
//! This module contains **zero `unsafe`**, as does every other file in
//! `src/inflate/`. In this crate `unsafe` is confined to `src/ffi/**` and the
//! private no-`std` runtime-support block of `src/lib.rs` (AAP §0.6.2,
//! preservation directive D-6); the crate root's `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` makes
//! that boundary a compile-time guarantee. This port is written entirely in
//! **safe Rust**: it uses bounds-checked slice indexing
//! throughout. The entry contract documented on [`inflate_fast`] guarantees
//! that at most six input bytes and at most 258 output bytes are touched per
//! loop iteration, so — for a well-formed stream honoring that contract — the
//! bounds checks never fail. Unchecked indexing is *not* available here, and at
//! 107%-127% of the C baseline's decompression throughput it is not warranted
//! either: introducing it would violate User Constraint 3 ("zero unsafe blocks
//! in core compression logic") and fail the crate-root `#![deny(unsafe_code)]`.
//! This module carries no `// SAFETY:` justification and needs none.
//!
//! # Byte-exact output
//!
//! The decode sequence, the bit-refill schedule, and — crucially — the
//! *overlapping* LZ77 back-reference copy are reproduced exactly so that output
//! is byte-identical to reference zlib (AAP §0.6.4, §0.8.1 directive D-1). The overlapping
//! copy (when `dist < len`) is performed forward, one byte at a time, so that
//! freshly written bytes are re-read; a `memcpy`/`copy_from_slice` would be
//! incorrect there.

/// ([`InflateState::hold`]/[`InflateState::bits`]), the decode mode
/// ([`InflateState::mode`]), and the input/output cursors.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// * `state` — the inflate state. Only [`hold`](InflateState::hold),
///   [`bits`](InflateState::bits), and [`mode`](InflateState::mode) are
///   written; the decode tables and window are read-only here.
/// * `input` — the available input bytes; `in_pos` is the read cursor into it,
///   advanced as bytes are consumed.
/// * `output` — the output buffer; `out_pos` is the write cursor into it,
///   advanced as bytes are produced.
/// * `start` — `inflate()`'s `avail_out` captured at the last state reset,
///   measured against **this same `output` slice**. Used to locate the earliest
///   output byte the current call may reference (`beg = output.len() - start`)
///   for the window/output copy decision.
/// * `lenfix` — the module-static fixed literal/length table
///   (`&crate::inflate::fixed::LENFIX[..]`); returned verbatim by
///   [`InflateState::lencode_slice`] when the active table is fixed. Passing it
///   in (rather than importing it) keeps this hot loop's dependency surface
///   minimal and avoids a borrow conflict at the call site (the fixed tables
///   are `'static`, independent of `state`).
/// * `distfix` — the module-static fixed distance table
///   (`&crate::inflate::fixed::DISTFIX[..]`).
///
/// # Entry assumptions (the caller MUST guarantee these; C `inffast.c` L23-L48)
///
/// * `state.mode == InflateMode::Len`
/// * `input.len() - *in_pos >= 6` (at least six input bytes available)
/// * `output.len() - *out_pos >= 258` (at least 258 output bytes available)
/// * `start >= output.len() - *out_pos` (`start` ≥ current `avail_out`)
/// * `state.bits < 8`
///
/// These invariants are what make the bounds-checked indexing provably
/// panic-free for a well-formed stream, and are asserted in debug builds.
///
/// # Return value
///
/// On a data error this sets `state.mode = InflateMode::Bad` and returns
/// `Some(message)`, where `message` is the exact zlib diagnostic string
/// (e.g. `"invalid distance code"`); the driver should store it into the
/// stream's `msg` field. On normal exit it returns `None` and leaves
/// `state.mode` at either [`InflateMode::Type`] (an end-of-block code was
/// reached) or [`InflateMode::Len`] (ran out of enough input or output),
/// matching C.
// This routine threads exactly the state `inflate_fast` mutates (the bit
// accumulator, mode, and I/O cursors) plus the two `'static` fixed decode
// tables. Bundling these into a parameter struct would only obscure the C
// LOAD/RESTORE contract the driver depends on, so the explicit list is kept.
