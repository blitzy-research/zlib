//! Raw-callback back-inflate (`inflateBack` / `inflateBackInit` /
//! `inflateBackEnd`) — safe Rust port of `infback.c`. Uses caller callbacks for
//! I/O and a caller/owned window; raw DEFLATE only.
//!
//! Unlike the main `inflate()` driver (which pushes decoded bytes into a
//! caller-supplied `next_out` buffer), [`inflate_back`] pulls its input and
//! pushes its output through **caller-supplied callbacks** ([`InFunc`] /
//! [`OutFunc`]), decoding a single *raw* DEFLATE stream (RFC 1951 — no zlib or
//! gzip wrapper) using a single sliding window that doubles as the output
//! buffer. This is the high-throughput entry point used by consumers such as
//! `gzip -d`'s core loop.
//!
//! The decoded output is **byte-identical** to reference zlib for the same
//! input (AAP §0.6.4, §0.8.1 directive D-1): the DEFLATE bit reader, the block dispatch, the
//! dynamic Huffman table construction (shared with the main driver via
//! [`crate::inflate::tables::inflate_table`]), the fixed tables
//! ([`crate::inflate::fixed`]), and — crucially — the overlapping LZ77 window
//! copy are reproduced exactly.
//!
//! # Unsafe policy
//!
//! This module contains **zero** `unsafe` (AAP §0.6.2). All window and input
//! access uses bounds-checked slice indexing. The raw C function-pointer
//! callbacks (`in_func` / `out_func` in `zlib.h`) are *not* modelled here;
//! wrapping those into the safe [`InFunc`] / [`OutFunc`] traits is the job of
//! the FFI boundary (`src/ffi/inflate.rs`).
//!
//! # Relationship to `inflate_fast`
//!
//! Reference `infback.c` calls the shared `inflate_fast` hot loop when at least
//! six input and 258 output bytes are available. That routine
//! ([`crate::inflate::fast::inflate_fast`]) is written for the main driver,
//! where the output buffer and the history window are **distinct** allocations.
//! In back-inflate the window *is* the output buffer, so feeding it as both the
//! `&mut` output and the `&` history would require aliasing a single `Vec<u8>`
//! mutably and immutably at once — impossible in safe Rust, and a per-call
//! window clone would cost more than it saves. This port therefore always uses
//! the equivalent single-symbol decode path (a faithful port of `infback.c`
//! L446-L543). The emitted bytes are identical either way; the fast path is a
//! pure throughput optimization, not a correctness requirement.
//!
//! # `no_std`
//!
//! The implementation is `no_std` + `alloc`: it uses [`alloc::boxed::Box`] and
//! [`alloc::vec::Vec`] and never references `std`. The I/O callbacks are
//! expressed as traits so `no_std` callers can supply their own.
