//! Inflate state model: [`InflateMode`] (C `inflate_mode`) and [`InflateState`]
//! (C `struct inflate_state`) — a safe Rust port of `inflate.h`.
//!
//! This module defines the **data model** of the DEFLATE decompression state
//! machine. It contains no decoding logic; it merely holds the fields that must
//! persist between `inflate()` calls. The driver ([`crate::inflate`] `mod.rs`),
//! the fast decode loop (`fast.rs`), and the raw-callback back-inflate
//! (`back.rs`) all operate on an [`InflateState`], and the public streaming
//! type [`crate::stream::ZStream`] owns one as its
//! `StreamState::Inflate(Box<InflateState>)` variant.
//!
//! # Relationship to the C model
//!
//! The layout mirrors `struct inflate_state` from `inflate.h` field-for-field,
//! with three idiomatic transformations that make the whole decoder (outside
//! `fast.rs`) expressible in **safe** Rust:
//!
//! * **No back-pointer.** The C struct stores `z_streamp strm` — a pointer back
//!   to the owning stream. Ownership is inverted here: the stream owns the state
//!   as the `StreamState::Inflate(Box<InflateState>)` variant (per AAP §0.6.3),
//!   which is where the C `internal_state *state` pointer went, so the
//!   back-pointer is omitted entirely rather than modelled as a raw pointer.
//! * **Owned window.** The C `unsigned char FAR *window` (manually
//!   `ZALLOC`/`ZFREE`-managed) becomes an owned
//!   [`AllocBuffer<u8>`](crate::stream::AllocBuffer), which routes the
//!   allocation through the caller's `zalloc`/`zfree` hook when the `z_stream`
//!   installs an active pair and through the global allocator otherwise.
//!   Dropping the [`InflateState`] frees the window automatically, so RAII
//!   subsumes the `ZFREE(state->window)` performed by C `inflateEnd`
//!   (AAP §0.3.2).
//! * **Table offsets, not self-referential pointers.** The C `lencode` /
//!   `distcode` are `code const FAR *` pointers that may point *into* the
//!   state's own `codes[]` arena (dynamic Huffman blocks) or into the
//!   module-static fixed tables (`inffixed.h`). A self-referential borrow into
//!   an owned array cannot be expressed in safe Rust, so those pointers become
//!   `usize` offsets into [`codes`](InflateState::codes) paired with a
//!   [`TableSource`] discriminator. See [`TableSource`] and
//!   [`InflateState::lencode_slice`] for the resolution mechanism.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! This module contains **zero `unsafe`**, and that is *enforced*, not merely
//! asserted (AAP §0.6.2 / §0.7.2 standard S2, satisfying User Constraint 3
//! "zero unsafe blocks in core compression logic"). Three independent mechanisms
//! hold the line:
//!
//! 1. `src/lib.rs` carries a crate-wide `#![deny(unsafe_code)]`, so an `unsafe`
//!    block, `unsafe fn`, `unsafe impl`, `unsafe trait`, or `unsafe extern` block
//!    anywhere in this file is a **compile error**. Exactly two narrowly scoped
//!    `#[allow(unsafe_code)]` carve-outs exist — `mod no_std_support` (the
//!    freestanding `libc` allocator plus abort panic handler) and `pub mod ffi`
//!    (the C ABI boundary) — and neither covers the inflate layer.
//! 2. The crate-root boundary tests
//!    (`executable_unsafe_is_confined_to_the_designated_boundary` and
//!    `unsafe_code_denial_has_exactly_two_scoped_carve_outs`) re-derive the
//!    boundary from the source text, so smuggling in a *third* carve-out —
//!    which would still compile — fails the test suite.
//! 3. The `unsafe-boundary` CI job repeats the same assertions in a
//!    toolchain-independent shell check, so the gate still bites if the tests are
//!    weakened or removed.
//!
//! The module is also `no_std`-compatible: it references only `core`, `alloc`,
//! and the crate's own safe modules.

///   accumulator holds every value the algorithm produces without truncation.
///   All `NEEDBITS`/`DROPBITS` arithmetic in `mod.rs` / `back.rs` must therefore
///   also use [`u32`].
/// * [`total`](InflateState::total) is deliberately widened to [`u64`]. C
///   declares it `unsigned long total; /* protected copy of output count */`
///   (`inflate.h` L93), whose width is platform-dependent — 32 bits on Windows
///   LLP64, 64 bits on LP64 Unix. Fixing it at [`u64`] makes the counter behave
///   identically on every target, and it costs nothing observably because the
///   only place the value is compared against the wire is the gzip `ISIZE`
///   check, which masks it first (C `hold != (state->total & 0xffffffff)`,
///   `inflate.c` L1100) — a mask this port reproduces.
/// * [`back`](InflateState::back) is signed ([`i32`]) because it holds the
///   sentinel `-1` ("no unprocessed length/literal code yet").
